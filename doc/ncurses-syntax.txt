NCURSES SYNTAX FILE FOR VIM
---------------------------
This is a syntax file that enhances the c.vim file that is distributed with the vim text editor. The purpose is to highlight ncurses keywords, which is useful to avoid typos, and it makes your source code look pretty too.

To install, simply un-tar it into your ~/.vim directory and that's all there is to it.

If you use the pathogen plugin, un-tar this syntax plugin into your ~/.vim/bundle directory.
